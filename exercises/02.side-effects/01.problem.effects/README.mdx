# useEffect

üë®‚Äçüíº We want the query to update as the query params change through a
[`popstate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/popstate_event)
event. Once you added the `useEffect` hook, you then have to prevent the default
full refresh of the page when the user clicks the back/forward button.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I added a new utility called `setGlobalSearchParams` which allows us to set
the URL search params without triggering a full-page refresh. So whenever the
user clicks "submit," we update the URL search params. The trouble is, when they
hit the back button, the search doesn't stay synchronoized with the URL (yet).

You can take a look at <DiffLink app1={-1} app2={0}>my changes</DiffLink> for
details on what I did.

üë®‚Äçüíº Thanks Kellie. So what we want you to do is make it so when the user hits the
back button in their browser and the search params are updated, we update the input
value.

The only way to be notified of a back/forward event is to listen for the
`popstate` event. You can do this by adding an event listener to the `window`
object.

```tsx
window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {
	// update the input value
})
```

To test whether you got this right follow these steps:

- Go to <LinkToApp to="/?query=dog" /> (in a new tab)
- Add " cat" in the input
- Click "submit"
- Click the back button in your browser
- The input value should now be "dog"

That last step will be broken and that's what you should fix in this step.

	fix in the next step, so if you notice a bug... we'll get to it üòÖ

One more thing, we're going to need to retrieve the query param in two places.
Right now we get it to initialize our state, but we'll also want to get it when
the `popstate` event fires. So you'll be extracting that logic to a small
function. This will introduce another feature of React's `useState` hook that
we'll take advantage of for the first time and that is the callback form of
`useState`. So you should know that these are equivalent:

```tsx
const [val, setVal] = useState('hello')
// will result in the same thing as:
const [val, setVal] = useState(function getHello() {
	return 'hello'
})
```

What's the difference? The second form is useful when you creating the initial
state is computationally expensive. So it's a performance optimization because
it allows you to place the expensive stuff inside the function and then it will
only be called during the initial render. This is a bit of a tangent, but I
thought it was worth mentioning.

Typically it's unnecessary, but since we're making a function anyway, you can
simply pass the function to `useState` directly:

```tsx
// both of these work just fine:
const [query, setQuery] = useState(getQueryParam())
const [query, setQuery] = useState(getQueryParam)
```

You're going to be making the `getQueryParam` function. Got it? Great, let's go!
